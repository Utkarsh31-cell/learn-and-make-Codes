Comparing Time complexity :
Worst time complexity of Quick sort is O(n^2) and Merge sort is O(nlogn)
Best time complexity of both Quick sort and Merge sort is O(nlogn)

One of the Drawback of Merge sort is Space complexity problem in this case Quick sort is better or have hand over Merge sort 

This is the case why IDEs are using mix sort of quick sort and merge sort 

Quick sort is good for arrays while merge sort is good for linked list 

Merge Sort is already stable in case of equal arrays element while Quick sort is not so stable in case of equal elements in array
